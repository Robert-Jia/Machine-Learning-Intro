# This folder shows necessary steps to set up Jupyter Notebook and tensorflow environment



You can download anaconda-naviagtor online. It is pretty straight forward. 
After downloading, I reference [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGkZ9EARwzk) for downloading tensorflow environment

## Basically, the code you put in your terminal is: 
```
conda create -n tf tensorflow
```
Else, you could directly type the command in jupyter notebook
```python
!pip -qq install tensorflow
```

And the library would be downloaded so you can import it into your jupyter notebook.
