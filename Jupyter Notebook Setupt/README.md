# This folder shows necessary steps to set up Jupyter Notebook and tensorflow environment


You can download anaconda-naviagtor online. It is pretty straight forward. 
After downloading, I reference [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGkZ9EARwzk) for downloading tensorflow environment

I faced difficulties opening the terminal, if you have the same problem, just click the play button here

The code you put in your terminal is: 
```
conda create -n tf tensorflow
```
And the library would be downloaded so you can import it into your jupyter notebook.
