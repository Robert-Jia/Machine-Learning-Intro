## New skills learnt: 
- how to make smaller headings and organize the .md file

Questions: 
- Is there a more convenient way for me to upload these everday report? 

Also, I can start adding notes about specific tasks in the corresponding files from tomorrow. 
For example, add a .md explanation about the CNN networks in the CNN file.
