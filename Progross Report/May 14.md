# May 14 updates

## Organize Foldres into more readable files. 
The previous layout was difficult to go through and complicated. 
So I divide it into sections regarding out course syllabus. 
## Future questions: 
Update all the files into foldres. 
Add description/illustration about each topic: graphs, notes, important coding segments... etc.
