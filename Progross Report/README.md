# This folder records my everday learning from github
I use this floder as a place to write my daily progress and practise markdown syntax. 
##The cheatsheet included is extracted online [^1]


## May 18 Updates 
### I discovered that recording progress in separate files are redundent and difficult to read, and it is better to record them together in this file
### ~~Finished all the exercises and uploaded them onto github.~~
For one of the notebooks, I have some errors doing it one way and managed to do it the other way round. 
### Tasks undone: 
- Including meeting recordings. 
- Put description for each for
- **Incorporate coding pieces in a seperate folder so it is easy to find code examples**
