# This folder records my everday learning from github
I use this floder as a place to write my daily progress and practise markdown syntax. 
## Besides my daily progress report, there is a cheatsheet on markdown language included in this file. 
The cheatsheet included is extracted online [^1]


   
## May 12 Updates

### New skills learnt: 
- how to make smaller headings and organize the .md file

### Questions: 
- Is there a more convenient way for me to upload these everday report? 

Also, I can start adding notes about specific tasks in the corresponding files from tomorrow. 
For example, add a .md explanation about the CNN networks in the CNN file.

### Questions unsolved: 
- how to use terminal to commit and make changes (but I guess it's unneccessary because I already have github desktop.
