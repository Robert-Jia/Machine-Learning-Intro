# This folder records my everday learning from github
I use this floder as a place to write my daily progress and practise markdown syntax. 
## Besides my daily progress report, there is a cheatsheet on markdown language included in this file. 
The cheatsheet included is extracted online [^1]


## May 18 Updates

### ~~Finished all the exercises and uploaded them onto github.~~
For one of the notebooks, I have some errors doing it one way and managed to do it the other way round. 
### Tasks undone:

- **Incorporate coding pieces in a seperate folder so it is easy to find code examples**
