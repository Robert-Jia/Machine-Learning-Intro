# This folder records my everday learning from github
I use this floder as a place to write my daily progress and practise markdown syntax. 
## Besides my daily progress report, there is a cheatsheet on markdown language included in this file. 
The cheatsheet included is extracted online [^1]


   
## May 12 Updates

### Finished Today: 
- how to make smaller headings and organize the .md file

### Tasks for tomorrow: 
- Is there a more convenient way for me to upload these everday report? 

Also, I can start adding notes about specific tasks in the corresponding files from tomorrow. 
For example, add a .md explanation about the CNN networks in the CNN file. 

## May 13 Updates 
### Finished Today: 
- Learnt about markdown language
- Learnt about how to create repositories and how to make new commits 
- Downloaded GitHub Desktop and Pulled documents from online repositories. 

### Tasks for tomorrow: 
- how to use terminal to commit and make changes (but I guess it's unneccessary because I already have github desktop. 
- How do I synchronize my files on my local desktop onto the online repositories. 
- I created a file in the folder, but I'm unable to push it onto the online repository. 
- The folder does not show up

### Solved: 
- ~~This previous problem was solved by adding new documents in the folder!~~
- ~~By downloading github desktop, it is much easier for me to upload files and make comits~~

## May 13 updates 
### Finished Today 
- **Learnt new .md codes**
- I found a cheatsheet about .md syntax[^1], and I'll include it in the folder
### Tasks for Tomorrow: 
- Implement some CNN exercises
- Organize my folders so they look clearer and more readable

## May 14 updates

### Finished Today: 
- ~~Organize Foldres into more readable files.~~ 
- The previous layout was difficult to go through and complicated. 
- So I divide it into sections regarding out course syllabus. 
### Tasks for Tomorrow: 
- Update all the files into foldres. 
- Add description/illustration about each topic: graphs, notes, important coding segments... etc.

## May 15 Updates 
### Finished Today
- ~~Uploaded related pdf documents into each folder~~
- ~~Working on several exercises, yet unable to complete neither of them~~
- ~~Reviewed video explainations on nerual network basics~~

### Tasks for Tomorrow: 
6 Exercises left, finish 3. 

### Future: 
Start Paper reading on different topics. 


## May 16 Update

## May 17 Updates

### Finished Today: 
- ~~4 Exercises~~ 

### Tasks for Tomorrow: 
- 2 Exercises left
- Improve the layouts to be more user friendly. 
### Also from tomorrow, I'm going to include the progress in one single file instead of distributing them in different files this is difficult to view over

## May 18 Updates 
### I discovered that recording progress in separate files are redundent and difficult to read, and it is better to record them together in this file
### ~~Finished all the exercises and uploaded them onto github.~~
For one of the notebooks, I have some errors doing it one way and managed to do it the other way round. 
### Tasks undone: 
- Including meeting recordings. 
- Put description for each for
- Move previous progress reports into this README.md 
- **Incorporate coding pieces in a seperate folder so it is easy to find code examples**

## May 19 Updates: 
### Finished tasks: 
- ~~Revised this .md description to make it more readable~~
- ~~**Incorporate coding pieces in a seperate folder so it is easy to find code examples** ~~

### Tasks for tomorrow: 
- Including meeting recordings. 
- Put description for each for
- Move previous progress reports into this README.md 
- Rename repository and Folders to increase readability.

Eigenvalue for PC1: SS for PC1
Singluar Value for PC1: sqrt(SS for PC1)
SS(PC1)/n-1 = Variation for PC1
