- Learnt about markdown language
- Learnt about how to create repositories and how to make new commits 
- Downloaded GitHub Desktop and Pulled documents from online repositories. 

Unsolved concerns today: 
- how to use terminal to commit and make changes (but I guess it's unneccessary because I already have github desktop. 
- How do I synchronize my files on my local desktop onto the online repositories. 
- I created a file in the folder, but I'm unable to push it onto the online repository. 
- The folder does not show up


- This previous problem was solved by adding new documents in the folder!
